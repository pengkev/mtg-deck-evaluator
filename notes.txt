As of February 10, 2026:
Data from mtgtop8 from the last 365 days on cEDH decks has been scraped.

Next steps:
scrape more decklists from more steps
separate into training, validation, training

build card2vec embeddings (will need a lot more decks)
use card2vec embeddings to treat decklist strength prediction as a transfer learning problem (fine tune and adjust model), presumably card2vec has allowed for the translation of card rules text and power to come through


things to ponder:
how to evaluate cards like arcane signet or sol ring? command tower?
